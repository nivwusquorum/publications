\section{Related Work}
One of the earliest mentions of a scheduling problem being solved in an algorithmic fashion can be found in \cite{johnson1954optimal}, although there's evidence that the problem was already considered in unpublished versions of \cite{bellman1956mathematical}. This publication considers the following statement of scheduling problem. We have $n$ items and $m$ stages and $A_{i,j}$ denoting the time for $i$-th item to be processed by stage $j$. All the items must be processed by different stages in order (for example first stage is printing of a book and second stage is binding). The publication considers $m=2$ and $m=3$ and arrives at the solution that \textit{``permits one to optimally arrange twenty production items in about five minutes by visual inspection''}. It turns out that the solution to the problem for $m \geq 3$ is NP-hard (\cite{garey1976complexity}). In \cite{wagner1959integer} an Integer Programming solution to the scheduling problem was presented, with a comment stating that it \textit{``is a single model which encompasses a wide variety of machine-scheduling situations''}.

In \cite{pritsker1969multiproject}, a generalization of scheduling problems is considered, which allows for multiple resource constraints. However, the proposed solution uses a discrete time formulation, which, depending on required accuracy, can substantially decrease performance. In 1988 a technique was proposed which can handle resource constraints and continuous time (\cite{bartusch1988scheduling}). The proposed approach can be thought of as resource constrained scheduling over Simple Temporal Networks (STN).

In \cite{dechter1991temporal}, a notion of Simple Temporal Problem was introduced which allows one to solve problems with simple temporal constraints of form $l \leq t_y - t_x \leq u$. This concept was later extended with various more sophisticated notions of temporal constraints. \cite{vidal1996dealing} defined an uncertain temporal constraint, where the duration between two time events can take a value from an interval $[l,u]$, which is unknown during the time of scheduling (uncertain duration constraints). \cite{morris2001dynamic} describes a pseudopolynomial algorithm for handling uncertain duration constraint, where we are allowed to make a scheduling decisions based on knowledge of uncertain durations from the past (Dynamic controllability). The algorithm is later improved to polynomial complexity (\cite{morris2005temporal}). Finally, \cite{Fang2014} provides a non-linear optimization based solver for uncertain temporal constraints where the duration of the constraint can come from arbitrary probabilistic distribution.
